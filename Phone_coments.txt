What&#39;s he saying!?
So is there just no way to use headphones like Beats with these phones? Is there no way to produce music anymore?
I ordered one a couple of days ago. Really hoping it&#39;s a great phone. The size isn&#39;t as small as iphone13mini (photo quality sucks and no fingerprint recognition) or my beloved a3 2017 that I still use. But I got to the stage that I need a solid compact phone that does my day to day task without any technical glitch. Reviews are looking good.
Thanks for review! I would like to ask is there other way to get full screen picture? Tried &quot; show camera cut out&quot; option but still not a full screen when watching Netflix or YouTube. Any tips? Thanks
I&#39;ve had the Samsung Galaxy S8 since 2018 or something, and Im now gonna upgrade to this S23. What can I expect in comparison?
Looks fantastic
Joke
I just got this as an upgrade on O2 black Friday deal with 3 months prime as my option then the Samsung triple deal 12 months Disney + some FE buds and ¬£100 cashback, the key part being the phone cost until midnight tonight was nearly ¬£300 off so yep happy days arrives tomorrow :)
the deal breaker for me here is the 3.5mm jack
And now they&#39;re going back to Exynos with the 2400, which has the same battery consumption as the 2200 ie shit.
Yoo
How is the low light photo quality on the s23 <b>plus</b> compared to the s23 model..??<br> the poor quality low light photo&#39;s is why I&#39;m giving up my A54üëéüèº...
S23 Premium Compact best Phone of 2023year.
why do people not speak in a clear voice nowadays?
Hi, ANY idea if this phone comes with Headphone jack port ??? Asking because A54 not having this important port. Thanks so much for the answers
Very informative with the odd bit of comedy too which is right up my street. Very very tempted to get this!
The exynos chipset in the s21 must‚Äôve really sucked. I had an S21 here in the U.S and I never had a battery issue. I‚Äôd say my iPhone 14 has had a worse battery life.
I&#39;ve had my S10 for 4 years now and it&#39;s time for a new phone. Been looking into the S23
I love watching things i can&#39;t afford‚ù§
I just f8nanced an S23 and it is such a great phone.. so far so good.. 8gb ram is really reliable..
You had me at Joe Pesci
Sir I applaud you for describing battery life as &#39;gash&#39;
&quot;joe pesci&quot; sized üò≠
üëçüí•üí™
Exynos was reason I ditched Samsung in UK I will stay on my iPhone now :)
That was very pretty good to the point review of the s23 series, but i would also like to know where did you get those anime wallpapers from, is it an app or from the internet
I traded my galaxy s22 ultra for the s23 ultra. i only paid $525 for it after tax and everything but it was like $450 pre taxed and let me tell you i love it. I was thinking about getting the s23 plus but i mean i got a really good deal and then i got my mom a flip 5 after she traded her flip 3. In total i paid what i would have paid for a s23 ulttra with no trade in. Sorry i just got really excited i had to tell someone. lol ooh and then there was this guy who had an iphone and switched to samsung. Its better to trade in your phone so you will get the new phone at a cheaper price. This is my first time doing trade in.
My old s9+ has a 1440p display at FAR better resolution than this 1080p garbage.
Thanks for this review.  I was on the fence, but this will definitely be my next phone. I dislike the huge phones.
Bought the s23+ version, its absolutely amazing. no issues at all, gaming performance is perfect
Do you watch Japanese anime?  I see anime characters on your phone.
Your are hilarious!  Love the review!!
if anyone happen to have an old samsung phone just laying around collecting dust.. I&#39;d be happy to have it or buy for cheaper price, I&#39;m still using my Samsung s9. I still choose Samsung over all iphone tho! Samsung is the best ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Awaiting an S23 to replace an s20 fe!
Every couple of years at upgrade time, I find myself watching this channel and I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, yeah! It&#39;s that guy again! Nice to see him!&quot; üòÖ
Got mine 230pounds trade in and codes here in Oz bargain from $1300
I went from s22 ultra to the s23 because of size and I&#39;m in looove with the 23 in every sense
To put this phone in one word.. SUPERB is the right choice! In a world of big screens, Samsung has just pulled an ace of their sleeve with this phone.<br>Battery backup is really good for  3900mah capacity.. i get almost 2 days with moderate usage.. <br>There is a feature called modes and routines in OneUI which I use to put the phone on power saving mode automatically every night.. that helps a lot with the battery..<br><br>Performance. No issues at all.. i have used several phones from Samsung with Exynos, Mediatek and Snapdragon 6/7 series chips.. but the 8gen2 on this s23 is a beast.. kicks everything you throw at it with style..  Camera is a decent performer too..<br>Besides the phone looks very professional in the office setting..<br>i strongly believe this phone is a piece of history and we don&#39;t know if Samsung will continue making 6.1&quot; phones guys.. it is expensive for people with midrange phone budgets.. if u can afford, save up and get it while its still on sale.. the S23 should most probably be pulled off the shelves once S24 launches around q2 2024..<br>Note that i am a long term Samsung user and will never ever ever think of switching to another brand.. (not even AppleüòÖ)
Samsung s23 üòä
Can you use wireheadsphones with USB-C port with this phone or will it not support it? I am not a fan on wireless headphones...
PLEASE tell me where you got that wallpaper
Another great review.  You power up your quick sharp mind and the deliver¬†funny punchline after funny punchline.  I love your comedy dialogue.¬†And then you deliver the vital data too...¬†  A proper solution (to phones that are pigs) is to have a swappable battery.¬†Will the vendors give us what we want ?
I love my Samsung Galaxy S23 added this amazing phone to my collection of phones along side my iPhones
Are you kidding? Feels good  to hold? Deserve  an oscar for that man. Terrible  design phone.  Hope you like  pinky lock.  Get ready  for  permanent arthritis.
I love on how you did your review, testing this device with Genshin Impact! I&#39;m using Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra right now and planning to switch on smaller, compact, yet powerful device to handle Genshin Impact since I wanted to play this game even if I&#39;m not on my PS4. I am worried that since S23 had small compromises‚Äî the gaming experience might not as good.<br><br>With Flip 5 coming up, I still decided to jump on S23 for durability. This game is really demanding when it comes to processing. Glad that S23 could keep up. T w T
Samsung S23 is the same size if not slightly larger area of an iPhone 14
I don&#39;t blame Apple for discontinuing the mini iphones I mean almost everyone loves a bigger better spec phone with a bigger screen also ya pay enough for it so it&#39;s better value for the money than buying a mini for almost the same price as the regular iphone. That Galaxy S23 is nice but I&#39;m looking for something special and just better than everything else so I&#39;m torn between the Sony Xperia 1 5 or The Asus ROG 7.
I really really want to use Samsung phones. I have used them in the past till S5 since I started using Nexus/Pixel I cant use Samsungs anymore. The only reason is their app drawers is horizontal and not vertical. I know that&#39;s petty but I really want app drawers to be vertical or at least an option. I am missing out on such good phones due to that. 
<br>
<br>I know can use Goodlock but that solution is horrible and also I like to use my phone as stock as possible so no launchers for me. I think phone software are great now that you shouldn&#39;t need a launcher.
I read from different sources and youtubers that the 128gb version occupies a huge space for the operating system, and its not a good idea to buy one with 128 gb storage. It differs from country to country.  Can anyone from UK help me to to decide if its ok to go for the 128 version? Please
iPhone end of ,android are crap full stop
Where can I get your anime wallpaper please I need it
Hey manüòÇ props to you, I like your style. üòÇüòÇ
im buying 1
I am curios is the smaller size of the s23 noticable and does it feel bad for example during gaming or is it not noticable???
Genshin looks horrible on galaxy wtf is with the colors?
My phone is broken need 1 üò¢ please please
I use a Samsung s10e and this has what iv been waiting for.
What would you say was the best Samsung phone for around ¬£25-30 per month
Please compare s23 with asus 10
Lemme get that bro? I got 500 for ya.
I have the S23 256GB in Green and it&#39;s the best S line samsung phone that i had and i had samsung phones for a decade, the size is perfect! I always had the note&#39;s after that all the Ultra models but they where always to big for me, i bought them to show off with and for the size but it wasn&#39;t my thing to be honest. So i decided to go for the base S line samsung S23 for the very first time and i thought i would regret it but i don&#39;t in fact this is exactly what i wanted and needed! I&#39;s a compact snappy phone perfect to handle with one hand so really a pocketfriendly phone, the battery life is more than good it&#39;s also better than i expected! What else do you need than this as i said it&#39;s a pocketfriendly phone with a very powerful chipset and power efficient and the One Ui is smoother than ever! From now on i will always buy the base S line phones from samsung you get the most bang for the buck, instead of a 1000-1500 bucks for the plus or Ultra version wich i really don&#39;t need and miss. Btw no hate for the plus and ultra owners, there beasts!
Who&#39;s the black guy behind u in the start of the vid
Is there a way to disable Picture Softening in S23?
Upgraded from my Ericsson brick phone to an S23 literally blew my mind
I have it and love it....
Hi where do you get your screen savers from they are mega
Love how you used a bunch of anime girls for the backrounds
Hello there so sorry to trouble you whst s23 model and storage do you use.<br><br>When using  camera does it use alot of your battery ?
Fckin fancy talking mister TS! Thanks for review!
What&#39;s the sound like please? I have a s23 ultra and believe it or not, I&#39;m thinking of selling it for the vanilla s23. It&#39;s just too big and heavy. But it does have good sound both speakers and headphones.
Great presentation üëè
I currently have a Samsung S10 which I have had since October 2020. The battery was never that great, but now it&#39;s only lasting about 2/3hrs of heavy use. I reckon the S23 will be a worthy replacement, may be in another 6 months as I want to eke out as much time out of my S10 as it&#39;s cheap.
It&#39;s wierd to me how reviewers complain about short battery life in new phones. Makes no sense to me coz one of my 4 in year old s10s lasts all day on one charge .
Brilliant phone but needs better even speakersüòäüòä
Hiya I have the Galaxy s23 ultra with  love the 512GB Version.we was execpecting a big June update with fixs for the camra. But learnt last night. That&#39;s not happening nowüòÆ I think this is now supposed to happen in July  can confused this?
I am not a native english speaker and not fluent enough to follow your accent and your jokes yikes
Definitely the best reviewer on here. üòÇ
Should I turn on protect battery for s23 base model 128gb
Watchin this from S23 green 256gb ‚ù§
would this beat my p30 pro in camera?
Just treated the missis to the S23. Samsung fantastic trade-in on Flip 3 so should see a fantastic upgrade on battery and camera. <br>Great review as always.
Absolutely great phone!
ok a phone that&#39;s not made for gaming - why max out the settings to game??????
1440p is my minimum. They put that in the S24+ and I&#39;ll come back. OnePlus 10 Pro for now
Ive switch from s21+ (exynos) to s23. Man, my s23 has better battery than my old phone.
I have the s22 ultra right now im seriously considering the s23. I feel that the s22 ultra is just too big. I wasn&#39;t keen when i first got it but learned to deal with it. Now my upgrade is available s23 is what i believe i will go for. My biggest issue though, I&#39;m very much into photography and worried moving from the ultra to the base phone may cause me to regret my decision. Any advice?
Finally upgraded my s21 after almost two years and the s23 doesn&#39;t disappoint: main improvement is that battery life is so much better and the annoying &quot;15% battery saving mode&quot; is now a thing of the past.
Cheers bro love your comments always am buying either a Samsung s23ultra or s24ultra depending on how the processor is after it is on the market a while but one simple question I have for you is it absolutely any way worth buying with all these screen structure problems that shows straight up across the screen and particularly the corners where they basically made a cock up in it a lot of people are returning them back üò≠üò≠
They galaxy S23 battery is on the exakt Same Level as the Galaxy S21. I have both of them and the S20 too.
s23 is a banging phone once the samsung crap is unistalled,its fast,but the finger print reader is awful with a screen protector on,and that screen is dog shit, considering its a&quot;¬£899 phone  the screen is so washed out<br>had the phone2 weeks and cant wait trade it for iphone 15 later this year
Call me old fashioned but this phone is not compact in my view.<br>For what I consider a compact phone, compact phones do not exist anymore.
I don&#39;t like the display for this price, they could have done it with a bigger resolution, they want to hunt with bran monkeys, not that they don&#39;t exist, unfortunately things don&#39;t work out that way
Just upgraded from S21, yep, this small device has a great battery life, camera is better, it doesn&#39;t heat in the games and performance is almost twice, so I am happy with this acquisition. I was in balance with Zenfone 9 which is little bit smaller but I thinsk S23 is the right choice due lastest smartdragon processor version 2
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZF8k_6xPVc&amp;t=11m02s">11:02</a>, is the guy taking a picture of you? xD
Recently bought a Galaxy S23. It&#39;s amazing, fast, bright &amp; loud. The battery &amp; charging is great too...Rule #1: Always buy a tempered glass screen protector &amp; a shock proof case immediately for your smartphone
Great review from my favorite English tech bloke.
I just got mine today. I&#39;m pretty happy
Im thinking to upgrade from s21 plus to s23 is it worth it
Who cares for the reviews üòÇI am subscribed only for your awesome English üòÖ
Sadly it seems you can&#39;t get the s23 with 512Gb...only 256. still getting it tho
According to the findings of a study, finger arthritis has grown dramatically since smart phones grew larger.
wallpaper. please
&quot;Joe pesci&quot; sized lol
I&#39;ve been with iPhone for over five years; this is the phone that&#39;s made me go back to Samsung. Finally, a camera and battery that is more than decent!
How can you get 6+ hours of screen on time...My s23 is 1 week old and I get 4-5 hours screen on time and I am a very light user...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZF8k_6xPVc&amp;t=2m18s">2:18</a> - i&#39;m sorry we&#39;re talking what?<br><br>jk, great review as always
Please where do i download his anime Wallpapers???
Bro what is Bixby..no seriously ..what is it
SUBSCRIBED - Got to get you to 1M subscribers üòÄ
I don&#39;t agree on the design aspect, I do get excited about the minimalist design. Love it!
Give it a rest about the bloody headphone jack nobody cares anymore we all have Bluetooth headphones the ones who haven‚Äôt stay living in the past!!!!!
Dude! You crack me up! Love the review
The best tech reviewer ever. Love your witty sense of humour buddy üòÇ. New subscriber here üëè üëå üòÄ
Turns out S23&#39;s = no micro SD card slot.  None of the S23 have a micro SD card.  That&#39;s an easy pass.  I&#39;m keeping my S22 Ultra with an extra 1TB micro SD card.  Maybe the S24 or S25 will have a micro SD card.  Not paying $1,200 for a phone without a micro SD card.  If Samsung wants to drop the price to $800 then I might consider the S23 Ultra.
Have any of you switched from samsung galaxy s7 to this samsung s23? What impressions?
what was hat movie you playing thinking going from oppo to s23
Samsung missed opportunity again against Apple to beat them with video recording üôâüôâüôâüôâ
You guys know some more light phone softwares outside of zenui, pixelui and NothingOS?
What do you think about the &quot;bananagate&quot;? I wanted to buy this phone, but now I have second thoughts because of this. :(
Minimalism is best for tech. No need for garish designs
I&#39;m definitely hoping to get this, this month. I wish they made the S23+ the actual S23 and gave it 12GB RAM and made it just a bit pricier than the actual S23.
Excellent review which I enjoyed watching and you gave top notch information HOWEVER, being an American, your fast speaking, Brit accent was at times difficult to follow. I still gave you a Thumbs up, thanks for all the great info.
Which would u recommend sir iPhone 14 pro or the Samsung s23 with emphasis on value for money? üôè
Why does it only support 45 watt charging considerimg its a flagship?
Is motion blur on photos still an issue? My S22 ultra is useless.
Looking to upgrade my Samsung s20 plus as I&#39;ve had it for 36 months and the s23 seems to be the perfect upgrade üëå great review cheers üçª üëè
My working 2016 S7 edge only does 3g, my S23 comes today, wonder if I&#39;ll notice the difference...üòÅ
I would definitely get the + or ultra but I can&#39;t stand the huge size.  Why can&#39;t they make a compact ultra??  I am jumping from an S7 (fantastic but elderly) to an S23 soonish.
S23 vs Pixel 7...thoughts ?
Hi, I have a question I&#39;m still using the Samsung galaxy s7 edge at the moment. Will my music sound better through my Samsung  ear buds pro&#39;s  if i  upgrade to the galaxy s23 or the s23 ultra.üëçüëç
Wallpaper?
Bixby well underrated when using your phone hands free.
&quot;If you&#39;ve had a couple vodka tizers, you can pretty much forget it.&quot; LOLOLOL. And THIS is why I enjoy every single damn one of your reviews, Chris, and I don&#39;t even care WHAT kind of tech you&#39;re reviewing....I&#39;ll watch it for tidbits like this.  :)
this would be the perfect small phone if it had a 3.5mm headphone jack + microSD slot + UFS 4.1 with the 128gb version; Samsung is as bad as Apple when it comes to being anti consumer, rn there is NOTHING worth upgrading from my V50 :/
I currently own a S7 and I&#39;m looking to upgrade to S23 this year. what a massive jump. I&#39;ve been using this good boy for 6 years now and signs of being outdated are showing.
I just want a phone like HTC ONE. Looking and feeling premium, while still being an awesome phone
Oneplus 11 or Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra or iPhone 14 Pro Max - I&#39;m going to USA üá∫üá∏ in few months, I really need to purchase a phone in India üáÆüá≥ right now, so which one would you recommend me? I&#39;ll go with 256 gb varient. Please Lemme know.
Im gonna be upgrading from a Samsung Note 9 to the Galaxy S23 soon. The only things im gonna miss is the s-pen and the headphone jack. Thanks for the review, im excited to get mine.
I just upgraded to the s23 and it&#39;s being delivered in a few days. It&#39;ll be nice to have a longer battery life, I&#39;ve literally been using previous galaxies (I currently have an s21) on &#39;power saving mode&#39; exclusively. It shouldn&#39;t be normal to be on power saving mode 100% of the time
Looks simplistic <br>Good
I‚Äôm looking forward to going from my iPhone 13 to the s23 plus. Time to get away from Apple. Big question what is that messaging app that you have I‚Äôve seen multiple content creators with that same messaging app
No SD  card support! Wtf garbage is that?
I&#39;m currently still using my samsung galaxy s7. I think it&#39;s time for an upgrade.
S22 is garbage the worst phone I&#39;ve ever used in my life I can&#39;t wait to get rid of it
I&#39;d rather stick to my old Galaxy S8+ than switching to a newer phone that doesn&#39;t have a 3.5mm headphone jack üò™ I wear headphones pretty much all of my waking hours and I really hate bluetooth headphones. I don&#39;t want to charge my headphones all the time and the sync between audio and video on bluetooth headphones are terrible.<br><br>PLEASE developers, bring back the 3.5mm headphone jack! I don&#39;t care about waterproof ratings. I&#39;ve never had any problems with any of my phones anyway. And even if my phone becomes water damaged due to the 3.5mm jack it&#39;s still a risk I&#39;m willing to take. I rather repair or even buy a whole new phone than trading away the 3.5mm jack.<br><br>(Yes I am aware of the USB-C to 3.5mm converter. But it doesn&#39;t allow you to charge your phone and listen to music at the same time. And some people has reported a significant loss in audio volume with these converters.)
I am finally upgrading to the s23 from a s10e. Getting my phone tomorrow. Hope I dont regret it.
the charging time is really outdated. xioami phone will charge upto 80% in 30 mins using theyr 57w charger. Using the same for S23 , it only charges 40% in 30minutes. bollocks really
How does it compare to the Galaxy S21 Ultra battery life?
Many people are moving away from bricks in their pockets to more easy to hold phones.
My s10e lasts 10-3 on call with buds on ( blue tooth),<br>Then 3-8 moderate use and still be at 20%
Bixbi üòë Samsung put us out of our misery and let it go
As usual(i.e., as of this post)with Samsung phones, compared to the iPhone Pro and Pixel 7 series, Galaxy phones suck at capturing pictures of moving subjects (e.g. kids) mostly blurry free üò¢. Year after year Samsung can&#39;t get the latter right. Love the Galaxy S23 otherwise.
S23 vs Xiaomi note 13 pro, which one would you pick for the same price? Here in India both cost 850$<br>700¬£
Thanks, My friend used to game on his S21 ultra. Nice to have an idea what choices are out there.
Bigsby? üòÇ
Just upgraded from the s21 battery was the one thing is hated. So I hope this is a good upgrade. I hate massive phones so always just go for the standard size one. I just wish they did an ultra mini or something.
I currently use my S20 which I&#39;m very happy with even to this day, but I am debating on whether to upgrade for the S23 or keep my S20 and pay for a monthly Sim plan with Three UK.
what do you think: is it better s23 or xiaomi 13? <br><br>P.S.<br>i am an university student
Where to get those type of wallpapers...?
I am mostly interested in a good camera. I could get the iphone 13 pro and the base s23 for the same price. WHich would you reckon has the better camera system?
My man got the best wit in the game
Id go for it If it was of the same price as the pixel 7. Hence, i ended up with the pixel 7.
Can&#39;t beat my S10 plus.. and it has a headphone jack too .. Great cameras and sound.. Not necessary to pay out huge sums of cash for any S model that has come since the fabulous Samsung Galaxy S10 +..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZF8k_6xPVc&amp;t=5m18s">5:18</a>
Cheesy farts ü§£
Great review man i think i will go with this instead of the ultra..im currently using samsung a52..i hope you hit that 1mill subs üëä
This boy starts every video by insulting himself
Does the video playback still jitter and glitch? Like the s22 did.
Where u getting those anime wallpaper?
Which one is better S23 or pixel 7 ? I don&#39;t know which to buy.
which camera do you use?
Does it have NFC to?
Can you do a s23 and xiaomi 13 comparison please
Bro, I like the way you talk in your videos, sometimes, it&#39;s so funnier, hellll yeah, I subscribe, call me in üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Switched to the S23 from an LG G8. I loved LG&#39;s phones. To me they just had the perfect combination of features. I&#39;m going to miss my expandable storage and headphone jack for sure, but the better cameras and software will hopefully make up for it.
Still no SD card slot - fock it
üëçüëçüòòüòò
Why do you have cartoon girls on your phone
great review man, ill be coming back ;)
Where do you get the wallpapers from?
It&#39;s strange phones like this are compared to iPhone Mini, when it&#39;s the same size as the regular iPhone. But no one calls that a &quot;compact&quot; device ü§î
is s23 bezel symetrical? please reply
What would you was a better phone out of this and the Xiaomi 13?
Recyclables? And the cobalt?
The Samsung exclusive colors are a bit nicer<br>Especially the graphite where it&#39;s a smooth gray with matte black borders/outlines
May I ask, has anyone noticed any imperfections on the top corners of the screen (almost like there are faulty pixels when shown against a white/light background)? Moreover, I noticed a slight purple line running across the very bottom edge of the display. Feedback would be greatly appreciated.
super review !! thanks
Absolutely love your English accent and your choice of words versus ours in the üá∫üá∏.üòÇ love it! I‚Äôm actually going from having the iPhone 14 to this S23 phone! I‚Äôm hoping I love it!?! I was going to get the S23 Ultra but I to have tiny hands 6‚Äô8 inches is just a bit to big for me! I‚Äôm happy I found your review as it‚Äôs been the best out of others I watched! <br>One of the biggest things I know I‚Äôll miss is my Siri- she was so faithful and always listened to me- without ever talking back! Love her so much ! I‚Äôll miss you Siri!! ;)
Traded in my S8+ for S23+ ^^
My s21 plus took a nasty hit to the screen and my touches were becoming unreliable. Sucks but I bit the bullet to jump to this
Are you from Barcelona? p.s. great phone:) I&#39;m waiting mine green one:)
Ngl I came here watching the Makima wallpaperüò∂
Yo lo compre y solo uso para redes sociales
Is it just me or are you talking a little bit slower in this video compared to most of your others?<br><br>Personally I like it.
You&#39;re my favorite reviewer
This is my future phone when my Galaxy S21 dies üòö‚úåÔ∏è
Someone that has an a51 from 2019 this is just an insane upgrade
Hello everyone, is it a good idea to buy the s22 ultra these days?  Note that its price is less than a thousand dollars. My phone is the S10 Plus, and it is in a terrible condition. Now I am confused because my budget is about a thousand dollars, and I do not know whether to buy it or buy the latest Chinese devices?  I welcome your advice and thanks
Just one problem with the s23, they still cost way too much
Somene give him an oscar for the best review I&#39;ve ever seen. Funnier than Morecombe and wiseüòç

Another amazing video, thanks, I hope you enjoyed Barcelona, salud!!
I have a homie that works in Samsung - he says that they built Samsung S23 to show that Samsung S23 Ultra is better
A scummy things that those cunts at samsung always do is using parts with lesser quality for smaller markets like SEA, before the one good way to counter this is to get the snapdragon variant, which is always the US/internation version and has the best  qualityparts. Now we can&#39;t do that anymore.<br><br>Fucking samsung, you cheating cunt.
i hope it&#39;s no longer curved or edged
It looks like iphone all these new smartphones look more less the same with same tech
That design is so boring<br>Looks like your average shitty generic Chinese junk
Came cross your video wanted check it out.<br>Me and my son has the S23
Wow. Another phone
I miss the Samsung um interface over the iPhone. Way more functional and intuitive and smart. iPhone is more fluent with better battery and camera performance but that‚Äôs about it for the pluses.
Samsung has lost the battlefield years ago. Coming years will be more worst.
This was about as much fun as a walk thru a morgue on üéÉ night
Did they fixed the PWM flickering? Because that is the only thing I am concerned about

your crap learn to hold a phone
Brilliant review. So good to find an honest take on the phone. Thank you üòä
I really like mine. Great design and build, beautiful screen, the software is much better than recent galaxies. The camera is improved and challenges Pixel and Apple. My one gripe is the mediocre battery endurance. But it&#39;s passable. Don&#39;t forget to turn on the Super Fast Charging for the full PPS charging experience!
&quot;A breath of fresh after emerging from a cave full of cheesy farts&quot;ü§£üòÇüòÇ pure comedy gold right there! You should make a book on all of your phrases ü§£
Upgraded my 9-yo Nokia C2-05 to Samsung S23.  Aside from the obvious changes, I like its compactness when compared to other smartphones. Screen protection and Spigen Tough Armor were the second thing I did with the phone. A bit bulkier but the size still just right to fit in the pocket. Would have loved S23U&#39;s camera but not for that price and phone size. Overall satisfied with my new phone.
S23 or zenfone 9 ? Can you make a comparison?
Is that Artem Lobov  with British accent after my slap üòÖ
One UI is easily the best launcher around and Samsung&#39;s Google alternative apps are mostly much better especially their browser.
Why spend the extra money on the s23 vs Pixel 7 bargain?
For me, 6&quot; phones are perfect, and I don&#39;t have small hands, just don&#39;t like those giant tablets in my pocket... we need more phones like this. üëç
Can you please do a comparison between Samsung galaxy S23 vs Asus Zenfone 9..!!!
A powerful impressive phone but I&#39;d miss the sPen.
Can&#39;t upgrade from my 12 mini because I got nowhere to go in terms of size.
I miss the micro SD card alot. Thats one of the main reason i love Samsung over Iphone when i can purchase the base model and slap in a 512gb or 1tb  card instead of paying few extra hubdred dollars for more storage.
Does anyone actually use Bixby.
very good video sir, sorry to ask did you reduce in size or it the camera. also love your videos. pray for your health üôè
I bought the iphone mini 13, I returned it and got this one, The  battery is not good. I was surprised the mini battery worked better.I really wish it had worked for me. Will return later this week

Please can i have that wallpaper?
Bro where u get that Makima wallpaperüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Im still on s10 and imo the best phone Sammy ever released. Shame s23 doesn&#39;t have an audio jack. It would be an insta buy for me.
2 expensive and not worth, i got S20+ 2.5 years ago and my screen burned in, same will be with S23, max price should be 300‚Ç¨
The great improvement from the S22 is only the better accu time and a little bit the better sound of the speaker. I did an upgrade from the S22, have both now for using next to each other. I must say in normal use you see no difference. Same display (little more reddish than the S22), same speed, same charching, same mobile and wlan experience. So the S23 is a great Smartphone, but is it worth for an Upgrade? Puh, i think not, yes more Display time, but is it worth 400 Euros after trade in. Hmm, but i have it now, and my S22 goes away the next days üòâ.
Makima
Not Makima in the thumbnail cryingüòÇ
The GS23 is the most beautiful phone of 2023, and the best one as well.
&quot;Something Black Bothering me at the background!!!!üòÜüòÜ‚ò∫Ô∏è
That&#39;s not a s23 ultra ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
genfone 10 any rumours
hope its better than the pixel 7 pro. The battery charging and life is absolutley garbage on that!
Yes!! less heat &amp; longer battery life was plenty of reason to move from S22 to S23
Can&#39;t believe ten hag is reviewing phone now.
Why show the S23 Ultra when telling us about the features?
Can u share. On any link ur wallpaper please ‚ú®
I really really regret buying the S22.<br><br>The battery life is horrid.
I love the s23 design so eventually ready to change my iphone, but i still hesitate since iphone ios is the best and its special update and icons :(<br>Samsung if you wanna take over new customer? build your own OS with better. I am so hard to decide :(
Very entertaining for  a phone review üòÖ
Even the ZenPhone 9 doesn&#39;t beat the iPhone Mini. People with hand disabilities or amputees need smaller products. We need to see the needs of these people as well. I want a smaller S24.
I upgraded from S10+ to S23, and the improvement in the night mode is crazy. I took a picture of an (almost) completely dark room and it managed to produce a reasonably bright image. If the 23 Ultra is even better than that, then kudos to Sammy!
where you get the wallpaper ?
Hi! May I know where you get those cool looking wallpapers?
That story about the battery is bullshit in one video where the benchmark and 3D mark tests were done... S21 finished the test with 2 percent more than S23. So your story is shallow because maybe the battery has been improved
How much SOT did you achieve with S21?
Question to reviewer. Which feel more comfortable in hand,  zenfone 9 or s23? After iPhone 13 mini and its limited iOS I&#39;m back to Android, but it need to be smallest possible flagship
The moment I decide to switch to iPhone they suddenly &quot;nail&quot; the S series. Sorry Samsung but never  again.
Hi mate I am watching you about half a year. I get Zenfone 9 and I am interested with what do you think one is better than other ?
I got the s22+ last year and I do love but since I developed RSI I&#39;m thinking of switching to S23, it&#39;s good to see some improvements
Waste of time then
I saw POSE
baterry life was bollocks? not on the s21 man, get your shit straight
That small heineken analogy threw me off ü§£ü§£...
It would be great if Sammy would produce a similar A series phone with the same screen size. At least you would not feel the urge to rob a bank to enjoy a compact device. Sadly I can only notice that the A series only got an illegal load of steroids when it comes to size...
What about Selfi camera üì∏
So I own the S22 and S23 and I must say that the S23 is a really solid improvement over the S22. The battery life, as you say, was just awful on the S22. I&#39;ve noticed myself not picking up the phone on many occasions, to save battery, so that it wouldn&#39;t die when I was out at a festival for example. That triggered me to have a look at the s23 instantly,  when I noticed the rumors that it would have a Snapdragon Gen 2 (for Galaxy).<br><br>I&#39;m very VERY pleased with the S23. ‚ù§ Awesome Phone. Feels great in the hand and the experience is fantastic. Best Phone in years. üëåüèº<br><br>Thanks for the great recap.
Where can I get your wallpapers
always want this phone üò≠
Where to get the wallpaper from???
Support is also a big plus, Samsung are proving prompt updates and supporting their phones for 4 years now
No headphone jack?? Thanks, but no thanks.üòí
Didn&#39;t expect to see Makima over here
Great improvement from S22. I upgraded from S21+ to S23+. S23+ is the best phone I used so far. Samsung and Qualcomm team did a great job. Great in speed, display, battery life, and software.  Camera is great too. Hard to find out any bugs so far.
Based on your review of this phone, it appears that you extensively used it for about six hours by playing games, browsing the web, and watching YouTube videos. However, it is unclear whether this usage was conducted under controlled and scientific conditions to provide accurate statistics on battery life. Can you please provide us with more precise data on the battery performance of this phone? Thank you.
Most of the Samsung apps are better than the Google originals. The gallery app for example. Google Pictures isn&#39;t a real gallery in my opinion. I use it only for cloud backups. Don&#39;t understand why you complain about all the time.
Where do you get that wallpapers from
It‚Äôs like every year android phones get fixed.
I have also noticed that music stops playing in the background for no apparent reason. This is the first time I am experiencing a bug in One UI that too in a flagship. I never found any significant bug in the prior Samsung phones that I have used viz A52s and M32.
@Tech Spurt<br> The audio stopping dead is NOT a model &quot;feature&quot;, i started getting it too on my S20 i think 2-3 months ago, i think it came with some software update and never got fixed.<br>So correction there, definitely not a S23 issue, rather Samsung issue atm.
In my opinion USBC headphones are just as good üòÇüéâ‚ù§
Setup a battery drain comparison between the s23 and s23+ along with the 23 ultra.. that will create a clear cut understanding of which to prefer based on battery drain and charge based on a 25w supply.. Most people nowadays look at charging time first, battery drain is the secondary priority.. <br><br>This suggestion is assuming people want to exclusively  buy a Samsung device
Why I keep seeing the same design year after year .. üòÇüòÇ
@TechSpurt pixel 7 or s23 is better in terms of battery and camera
i am serious changing my s23 ultra with the regular s23...the ultra is too heavy and i don&#39;t use spen/200mp camera so yeah...
Idk your hands appear to be about average size/large size. Can you measure them?
Have an s22. Had an older lg g8 thinq.  Samsung cant match. Good camera though
you should do a video on graphene os on pixal phones its great
Where can you get those anime wallpaper
Where can I buy S23 with 512 GB? I haven&#39;t seen one sold anywhere, only 256
Where do you get the anime wallpapers do you have recommendation @tech spurt
Bought S23 for myself and S23 ultra for my wife. I&#39;d definitely recommend the s23. It exceeded all my expectations and aside from sPen, I don&#39;t miss out much. No issues with battery whatsoever. All round banger.
Bro, Can we use redmi 34 watt charger to charge this s23 ? Or should i buy a charger from samsung ?
SE3 VS S23 üôèüéâ
The Man
The Ultra is brilliant. Probably tons of stuff I&#39;ve not seen yet , nor ever likely to üòÇüòÇ
I came for an s23 plus review but imma stick around as a subscriber. You&#39;re hilarious man
this phone is awesome
Âçé‰∏∫
Got the base s23 in cream and it looks like a jewel and I love it... Camera does need an update to fix indoor images, the colors can be quite off indoors, rest everything about this phone is perfect... Don&#39;t wish to change a thing..
S23 or iphone 13 mini? I have bought my first samsung phone two years ago, the s20 fe eyxnos and ive been unhappy. Now im planning to buy my first iphone later this year and im eyeing the 13mini because of its sizeüòä
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZF8k_6xPVc&amp;t=6m05s">6:05</a> So, a twat is something that likes to heat up. New lesson learned.
I don&#39;t understand Samsung&#39;s marketing. First month you get these nice discounts and incentives, but after that, once the phone is older, you have to pay the full price? Makes no sense to me. I was considering S23+ but got busy with life and now all these nice deals on Samsung&#39;s website are over. I get that they are trying to create FOMO, but it just ends up being annoying and I think hurts their sales long term. I&#39;ve lost all interest in buying this phone because I know others were able to buy it at much better price for a month. Why do I have to pay more now?
I bought S23 after being Apple user for around 10 years...I love this phone. This is the Android phone I was looking for all these years.. Thank you Samsung.. I love it.
I hope you&#39;re okay and in great health.
So no difference between S23 and S23 plus?
You&#39;re the funniest reviewer l know üòÇüòÇ
Xiaomi 13 üòÅ
Iphone 14 is the same size as s23, why samsung is compact and the iphone no?üòÖ
Something behind the chair
Your complete honest and authentic reviews with hilarious banter is a breath of fresh air in the reviewers space, thank you! Road to 1M Subs lets go!!
I got s23 with litle dead pixel, now still repaired in SC.. üò™
I had the S22 Plus, gone back to my OnePlus 8 Pro and both have had issues with music stopping playing through both my Megaboom speaker and $500 Technics headphones. I only mention the names and price so you know it‚Äôs not cheap crap that‚Äôs not working. Sometimes it plays for 5 seconds, stops, I push play again, another 5 seconds and stops. I‚Äôve turned off auto battery optimisation for all the apps involved. Could it be an Android 13 issue?
Got me with &quot;Dolph Lundgren mega bastards&quot; ü§£
Samsung&#39;s ui is terrible why have you not got up and down scrolling in the basic menu for the app drawer..ü•∫
1080p display...yeah nah totally not gonna buy it.
Uncle Spurt, you&#39;re cheating when you compare the s23 to the iPhone mini and say that since apple doesn&#39;t produce mini anymore, s23 is the almost only small alternative. But s23 is 6.1 inches, exactly the same as regular iPhone 14. Gotcha.
Uncle Spurt, the  man with the florid analogies .
I have to know, do you put cases on your phones? I&#39;m dying to live the &quot;naked&quot; lifestyle.
Honestly my S21 has been excellent ever since the 5.0 update. It sips the battery quite nicely finally. For me it can get about 5-6 hours screen time, but the standby drain is significantly better than older versions
Using and love it!
From where i can find those wallpapers?
Glad to see you like Pose.
Meh I already have something I clutch and play with almost daily<br><br>But thanks mate
Idk man, I kinda like this design more than last year......looks like old school experia phones
Will you compare it to the Xiaomi 13?
Pose is so so so so good
Everything about this seems awesome. My only reservations come down to battery life. I currently get 10-13 hours of SoT on my 13 Pro Max with 30-50% battery left. This damn battery being so great keeps me from jumping ship.
Still rocking my S20 FE (I upgraded from an S8+) and I gotta say I love my current phone, but I&#39;m considering the new S23. Especially that green color. <br><br>Does anyone know which size matches the S20 FE? I have big hands and debating if I should just get the regular or plus. I think the S20 FE is the perfect size for me.
when the phone dont have 3.5mm jack is not a phone any more for me
Hope you do a similar review of the S23+üòâ
Excellent review‚Ä¶ thank you
You mentioned @4.02 that there is a s23 512GB option, well the base s23 only got 128Gb or 256Gb. Unfortunately no 512 available for the base s23.
Where do you get your anime wallpapers from?
Why is no one mentioning your impeccable anime taste? That Makima wallpaper was immaculateüëå
Just bought the Oppo Reno 8 pro. It&#39;s freaking amazing.
Battery test s23 vs 23+? Honestly idk witch one to buy beacuse of battery, charging speed and screensize...
Samsung need to fix the green line now. Consumers are extremely pissed.
Funny how we say &quot;pint-sized&quot; to mean small, given that the massive Ultra and other top end phones are literally the size and weight of a pint! ü§£
That&#39;s not true. The s23 only has a 128 and 256 gb storage option. No 512, unfortunately.
Aren&#39;t Apple&#39;s base iPhones about as small or even smaller than the base S23 ?
class video but have you got panda eyes?
Watching this video from a Xiaomi mi 10 pro.....   300¬£.....   So.....   Samsung S23 _ 1.000 ¬£   ....
This is the ideal phone for me. Top specs, regular size (perfect), good battery life.
the s23 shouldve had 4500mah battery,s23plus 5000mah and ultra 6000mah. they might have great battery now but battery would degrade in about 6mos so having bigger capacity would be great for longevity
Got the s23 after my asus rog went caput. Before that had the s7 edge. The s23 slaps. Getting more sot than the 6000mah rog phone and the size is the same as the s7. Cpu is blazing
Read Samsung&#39;s small print on that recycling propaganda dude.... It&#39;s impressive what they get away with!
You really believe what Samsung says about using recycled materials! That&#39;s just a load of crap. Every company today says the same thing.
What&#39;s the game is he playing? please reply
Superb!  I&#39;m still hanging onto the S10, this might finally be the upgrade.  Can&#39;t wait to finally be rid of the &#39;edge&#39;.
Had to choose between s23<br> For 1000$<br>Or s21 ultra for 699$<br><br>Choose 21 ultra and not regretting anything<br>Good size<br>Battery decent<br>Amazing camera<br>And cheap price<br><br>Thanks Samsung keep on Poppin more new phones and make those older phones cheeper
Bye bye to my good old 3310 say hello to my next S23 =)
S22 with bochi
9/10 phone. The best galaxy since the s10 series.
s23 only goes up to 256gb, please know what you&#39;re talking about when making a video
Hi, always very accurate with your opinions. Wanted to ask, Are your wallpapers from Pinterest or you get them from another source? Looks Cool üòé
Tech Spurt is the best reviewer. Love you man. Can always depend on you to brighten my day!
Now... Imagine a bit thicker phone and a 200mha more in the battery.... It&#39;d be just awesome!<br><br>It&#39;d also have a bit more space for the chip to cool and so on. Why making it &quot;oh so thin&quot;?! Didn&#39;t have to be ultra think. Just a bit more.
Qualcomm = Better Battery. Samsung picked right üëç
For some reason the battery drain on my s23 is too much I hardly get 5hrs of sot...waited for the learning phase to get over still no luck...I also did reset my phone and I am nowhere close to others s23,they get over 6 hrs of sot...also I am a light user ND I don&#39;t play games...
Samsung should have upgraded the main camera sensor this time.
Would someone care to tell me where I can get a 512gb S23 that all the reviewers are talking about? The Samsung website only shows max 256gb S23.
Better late than never üëç
I went with S23+. I like bigger phones, but Ultra is too bulky and the brick design is not for me. I prefer rounded edges. CPU is the same. I have full frame mirrorless camera, so I don&#39;t need the best mobile camera to be honest, so s23+ is perfect for me. <br><br>Nice to see older anime fans btw.
I love your comparisons or idealisms brilliant and funny
Please make s23 plus review
Went from an S7 (Dead) to an A52 5G (Alive) to the S23+ 512GB Black (For the same price as the 256GB one!).<br><br>Brutal (re)boot speed (Less than 30secs, no &quot;starting phone&quot; after block page). Noticed some big differences with the camera, both photo and vid.  Games loaded way faster than the A52 5G and ofcourse performed better (dev reason sense..) and memory isn&#39;t a problem since i&#39;ve bought a USB A + C pendrive to back things up in case the phone dies (Hopefully not...) and bought an Apple and a Samsung Type C to Jack adapter. Staying with Samsung&#39;s coz of the DAC chip inside (Apple in case the Samsung one dies)<br><br>Pretty happy so far!
A good balanced review. Watching on my S23 and I love it, however can notice the camera quality struggles in low light compared to my old S20 Ultra.
Chris, can I please have those old s22 please..
Will you do a comparison video vs the Xiaomi 13?
&quot;In a world full of Dolph Lungren mega bastards&quot;... üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ üòπ üòÜ ü§£
@techSpurt  when is video comming for best compact phone ? :D Zenphone 9 vs s23 vs Xiaomi  13 ? :P
Why can&#39;t Samsung increase the charging speed? Realme even has a 240w charging speed. If people are scared of frying the battery, then they can just use an 18 watt charger or something.
Does having the Snapdragon processor in the S23/Plus mean an FM radio comes as standard on the phone?

S23 plus battery is great when you do a lot of changes in the settings tbf
Prefer s23 + over s23 bigger screen and better battery life
low light videos suck in s23, batter life too is pretty average
I discovered you since the beginning of the pandemic and have been a fan ever since. Your sense of humor plus your knowledge and solid tests when reviewing a phone is what makes you one of very few tech reviewers who are genuine, at least in my opinion. Recommended your channel to my group of friends who are interested in buying a phone and they loved you. Thank you for all of your efforts in producing these videos, hope yoru channel gets more recognition than it gets already.
I love my s23
Where does he get the awesome Anime wallpapers?
Looks like you were in Barcelona? Wish I had known, would of bought you a pint!
Though I&#39;m glad we all got Snapdragon this year, Samsung should be sued for selling Exynos since the S20. They were utter crap when compared to Snapdragon, I can&#39;t believe that&#39;s what they gave use these past few years. I had S20 and S21 then jumped to S23+, and I really felt the performance and battery improvement.
Where do you get your wallpapers?

My man. Where&#39;s the Xiaomi 13 review? :P
FYI.. probably not a good idea to encourage people to splash water onto their phone and then say that it&#39;s water-resistant and not waterproof LOL
Samsung, come on bring back the Micro SD slot!!! Maybe then I will finally &#39;upgrade&#39; my S10+, but for now if you cut through all the crap, that phone is still superior to this excuse for a new phone!
I see, you&#39;ve gone bonkers for Makima
I love this guys reviews, so funny with his words
Awesome review as always uncle Chris! I have the exynos S21 and I hate it but I like how compact it is somehow. Do you recommend upgrading to s23 instead? Thank you
I love your wallpapersüòç Sauce for the Bocchi wallpaper please!
Why are you still talking about the headphone jack? IT AINT COMING BACK!

I am getting 5 hours of SOT and also many others not getting good enough battery. I don&#39;t know how all YouTubers are getting good battery
Samsung really need to work on their batteries. 1 yr and they&#39;re all discharging very fast
I know yall in Europe dealt with the S22 with the atrocious exynos chipsey the past couple years with terrible thermals and abysmal battery life but Snapdragon 888 and 8G1 users also dealt with literally the exact same issues and possibly worse. The common denominator is samsung foundry. Now that they&#39;ve gone to TSMC all&#39;s good.
Hey can you answer a question noone knows the answer to: Is there a seperate volume slider for something like the google nest when casting music? <br><br>I hate that Iphone only changes phone and cast volume simultaniously.
üëçüëè
I&#39;ve been loving the s23 standard its just awesome so far üëå üëè üôå
Samsung shd ve given at least 45w charging speed to this... 25w takes around 1hr 15min to fully charge the phone as opposed to the S23 ultra where the 45w charger takes abt 1hr... Also the ultra has much better battery backup than the vanilla version...
Zenfone 9 vs Galaxy S23! Ultimate compact phone battery life endurance

Looking to replace my s22 ultra with the base s23 as i hardly use the pen or the camera. Was wondering if is worth it?

Im still using my S20 5g. Finding it very difficult to move away to something new...
Still don&#39;t know which to buy.  Zenfone 9, Pixel 7 or this Samsung 23.. love compact phones
The only tech reviewer who never fails to crack me up, every single time! Thanks Chris, your reviews are good and your humour is the best! Shine on buddy
i only focus on his English. its definitely unusual and catchy.
Please compare the S23 against the xiaomi 13
I love these compact size
I&#39;ve been using my note 10+ for almost 4 years now and I&#39;m kind of tired of carrying something so big on my pocket üòí, going smaller is definitely calling my attention right now
I have both s23 and s23 ultra. Ill be returning the ultra, honestly the camera quality is almost the same except for the zoom feature. Battery in s23 is so good i wouldn&#39;t even miiss the ultra.
Amazing phone, can&#39;t wait mine
Very nice review

&quot;Joe Pesci sized blower...Dolf Lundgren big bastard...&quot; I don&#39;t even care about the phones anymore, I&#39;m here purely for the entertainment. If you&#39;re ever in Toronto, Chris, I&#39;d happily buy you a pint or six.üòÑ
Crazy that s23 base outlasts my s22U with battery left at the end of the day.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZF8k_6xPVc&amp;t=3m31s">3:31</a> That Bluetooth issue is caused by AAC codec, you can fix this by go into <b>developer options</b> then turn off <b>HD audio</b><br>And you need to do this <b>EVERY TIME</b> after connected to the bluetooth audio device ~_~<br>idk what Samsung did to the AAC codec but they certainly didn&#39;t check the irl compatibility
Straight to the battery section, THANK THE LORD THEY FINALLY FIXED!
I bought the base s23 with 256gb, and finally we have a compact-ish phone with 0 compromises. I loved my s20+ but it just never felt comfortable using one hand, s23 is perfect, i&#39;m getting 7 hours sot. As for the camera, download camera assistant app and turn on auto-hdr for better low light images.
Small phones aren&#39;t for me which is why I went ultra. Don&#39;t regret it for a second. The fact we now have a snapdragon chip but more accurately THE snapdragon chip that&#39;s probably the best they&#39;ve made so far,  is just glorious. Samsung clearly knew it would be business suicide to go exynos again when the gen 2 is just so ruddy good.
Love the big smartphone is too big for my &#39;stubby hands&#39; acting...
How to fix the music streaming problem stopping abruptly for no reason?

I was going to buy the s23 regular size but decided to buy the Google pixel 7 pro for less than the s23. I&#39;m happy with my choice!
We need compact mid rangers
Thanks Much !
